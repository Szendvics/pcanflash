Linux flash tool for PCAN Routers

This tool can be used to flash PEAK System PCAN Routers as an alternative to the PCAN-Flash Windows application.

As it is possible to build firmware images for the PCAN Routers with Linux this pcanflash tool was the missing piece to provide a complete toolchain for Linux environments:

This programm is currently tested with the PCAN Router IPEH-002210 with the binary files from the 1_ROUTING example.

So this software is at least BETA! Stay tuned :-)
